# clear-underwater-mc-pack
Resource Pack for Minecraft 1.13+ to make underwater biomes clearer and brighter.

Here is a series of resource packs for the Aquatic Update versions of Minecraft. They improve visibility in the water  for better building and exploring.

Choose the pack that you want from releases and place in the resourcepacks folder for your Minecraft instance. Select the pack from the Resource Packs screen under Options.

Clear Underwater Fullbright adds a lightmap file to increase the light levels underwater as well as in caves. It requires Optifine.
